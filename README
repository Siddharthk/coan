Welcome to the Comprehensive Opticks Archive Network (COAN).
This is a community site for hosting your Opticks plug-ins.
If you've got a plug-in or utility library you would like to release to
the Opticks community but don't have a place to host it, you can store it here.
The maintainers of this site reserve the right to remove any contributions at
any time should they be deemed inappropriate. You may choose to release your
plug-in under the LGPL license or the MIT license.
Please indicate which you choose in your README file.
