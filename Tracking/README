NOTE: Much of the code in this extension is licensed under the LGPL v2.1
as noted in the copyright header for the individual files. The extension overall
is licensed under the GPL v3 due to use of some GPL files. These files are
marked as copyright Rob Hess which he has licensed under the GPL v2 (see the zip
archive of the source for more information). I've decided to upgrade the
license to v3 of the GPL at the same time. If I ever remove the dependence
on Rob Hess' code, the overall license will likely revert to the LGPL v2.1.
